So that [Weave Net](http://weave.works/net), [Weave Run](http://weave.works/run)
and [Weave Scope](http://weave.works/scope) can be used *out of the box* in
[Amazon's ECS](docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/Welcome.html),
we provide a set of AMIs which are fully compatible with the
[ECS-Optimized Amazon Linux AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00U6QTYI2).

The following are the latest supported Weave AMIs for each region:

| Region         | AMI          |
|----------------|--------------|
| us-east-1      | ami-5f8ce33a |
| us-west-1      | ami-81c53fc5 |
| us-west-2      | ami-13766b23 |
